a new saliency-driven image fusion method based on complex wavelet transform for remote sensing images is proposed to satisfy different needs of spatial and spectral resolution for different regions

Libao Zhang and Jue Zhang, "A New Saliency-Driven Fusion Method Based on Complex Wavelet Transform for Remote Sensing Images," IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters, vol. 14, no. 12, pp. 2433-2437, Dec. 2017. doi: 10.1109/LGRS.2017.2768070.

The algorithm displayed here consists of three parts: Fuzzy C means, Slaiency analysis based on FCM and spectral dissimilarity, and the fusion framework based on complex wavelet tranform. 

Wavelet Toolbox is needed.
